When executing `npx tcsetup update`, the tool incorrectly appends data to customize.yaml files without applying any merge logic. This affects:
- `_bmad/_config/agents/core-bmad-master.customize.yaml`
- `_bmad/_config/agents/bmm-pm.customize.yaml`

The tool blindly appends data instead of intelligently merging it. The tcsetup implementation is located in `@packages/tcsetup/` and needs to be fixed with proper merge logic.
