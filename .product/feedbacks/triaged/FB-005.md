## Request Summary

Add two new commands to the `@tcanaud/playbook` package:

1. **`npx @tcanaud/playbook status`** - Display the status of all currently running playbook sessions
2. **`npx @tcanaud/playbook list`** - List all playbook sessions

## Requirements

Both commands should support two output formats:
- **JSON format** - for programmatic consumption
- **Polish format (default)** - for good terminal rendering with formatting

## Details

The user wants these commands to:
- Show status information for playbook sessions that are currently running
- List all available/existing playbook sessions
- Provide flexible output options (JSON for scripts, formatted text for human readability)

This is part of the broader playbook CLI enhancement effort to improve session management and visibility.
