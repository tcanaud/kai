Input validation is missing across all 8 kai packages. Feature IDs, file paths, and CLI arguments are not sanitized before being used in file operations, creating both security risks (path traversal via malformed IDs like `../../etc/passwd`) and reliability issues (silent failures on malformed YAML input).

**Proposed solution:** A shared validation utility providing `validateFeatureId()`, `validateYamlPath()`, and `validateCliArg()` functions that all packages can import. This would prevent silent failures, improve debuggability with clear error messages, and close a security gap.

**Scope:** feature-lifecycle, qa-system, agreement-system, product-manager, knowledge-system, adr-system, tcsetup.

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 hours.
