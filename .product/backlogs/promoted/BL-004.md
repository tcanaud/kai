Allow each playbook step to specify which model to use for execution. Currently, all steps run with the session's default model. This evolution adds an optional `model` property to the playbook YAML step schema. When a model is specified for a step, the supervisor should use that model; when omitted, it falls back to the current session's default model.

**Scope:**
- Update the playbook YAML schema to support an optional `model` property per step
- Update the playbook supervisor to read and apply the model setting when spawning tasks
- Update existing playbooks to remain compatible (no model specified = default behavior)
- Update commands that interact with playbooks (validation, creation, etc.)
- Follow the kai philosophy: zero runtime dependencies, file-based configuration

**Origin:** User feedback requesting fine-grained model control per playbook step to optimize cost, speed, and capability matching for different step types.
