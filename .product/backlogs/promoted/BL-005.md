Add two new commands to the `@tcanaud/playbook` CLI package to improve session visibility and management:

1. **`npx @tcanaud/playbook status`** - Display the status of all currently running playbook sessions
2. **`npx @tcanaud/playbook list`** - List all playbook sessions

**Requirements:**

Both commands should support two output formats:
- **JSON format** - for programmatic consumption and integration with scripts
- **Polish format (default)** - for good terminal rendering with user-friendly formatting

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Implement `status` command that shows running session information
- [ ] Implement `list` command that enumerates all available sessions
- [ ] Both commands support `--json` flag for JSON output
- [ ] Default output uses Polish format for readability
- [ ] Commands work with existing session storage at `.playbooks/sessions/`
- [ ] Zero runtime dependencies (use Node.js built-ins only)
- [ ] Integration with @tcanaud/playbook package versioning

**Related:** Part of the broader playbook CLI enhancement effort (015-playbook-cli-commands) to improve session management and visibility.
