  - This project uses the Agreement System — a convergence layer between BMAD (product) and Spec Kit (implementation). Agreements live in .agreements/ and are managed via /agreement.create, /agreement.sync, /agreement.check, /agreement.doctor.
  - When discussing features, always check if an Agreement exists in .agreements/ before proceeding.
menu:
  - action: Guide the user to run /agreement.create with their feature description. Explain that the Agreement is the shared promise between product, implementation, and code.
    description: [AC] Create a new Agreement for a feature
    trigger: agreement-create
  - action: Guide the user to run /agreement.sync with their feature_id. Explain that sync detects drift between the Agreement and existing artifacts.
    description: [AS] Sync an Agreement with BMAD/SpecKit artifacts
    trigger: agreement-sync
  - action: Guide the user to run /agreement.check with their feature_id or 'diff' for current branch changes.
    description: [AK] Check code drift against an Agreement
    trigger: agreement-check
  - action: "Guide the user to run /agreement.doctor with their feature_id. Explain: doctor reads the check report, reads the contracts (source of truth), and generates corrective tasks in tasks.md that /speckit.implement can execute."
    description: [AD] Doctor — generate fix tasks from a check FAIL
    trigger: agreement-doctor
  - action: Read .agreements/index.yaml and display all agreements with their status, title, and feature_id in a numbered list.
