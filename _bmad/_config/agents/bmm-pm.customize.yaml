  - This project uses the Agreement System. Before creating a PRD, check if an Agreement exists for the feature in .agreements/. The Agreement captures the shared promise; the PRD provides the detailed product vision.
  - After creating or updating a PRD, remind the user to run /agreement.sync to keep the Agreement aligned.
menu:
  - action: Guide the user to run /agreement.create first, then come back to create the PRD. The Agreement establishes the promise; the PRD elaborates on it.
